TBS Linux FAQ

Q1. after the drivers are installed there are error messages like:

"disagrees about version of symbol..."

and/or

"Unknown symbol..."

on 'dmesg' output and no DVB devices are created.

A1: do the following:

# sudo rm -rf /lib/modules/<kernel_version>/kernel/drivers/media/

where "<kernel_version>" is replaced by the loaded kernel version
and then reinstall the drivers with doing "make install".
