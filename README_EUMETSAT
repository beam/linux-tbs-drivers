EUMETSAT DVB-S2 service reception

In order to receive EUMETSAT DVB-S2 service you need supported TBS card model.
At the moment that means TBS 5925, TBS 6925 or the latest TBS 6983.

If you want to use TBS 5925 or TBS 6925 you need to de-activate "issy" module
parameter of stv090x driver. one of the easiest way to do that is to create
file in /etc/modprobe.d directory, named for example "stv090x.conf" with 
the following content:

# cat /etc/modprobe.d/stv090x.conf
options stv090x issy=0

and on the next driver load the new setting will take affect.

also, you need to specify the ISI to lock the signal, which is "-m" switch
on 'szap-s2' command line.

please, check other READMEs like for example README_TBS5925 for installation
steps or other general information.
