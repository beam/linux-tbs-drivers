HOWTO

Most of the steps require root access to the Fedora system and basic knowledge of Linux system. Create directory, for example /root/tbs and copy the following file to it:

- dvb-usb-tbsqbox-id5920.fw (QBOX2 USB firmware file)
- linux-tbs-sources.tar.bz2 (source code of S2API Linix drivers for TBS products)
- szap-s2.tar.bz2 (szap tool compatible with new DVB-S2 aware S2 API for Linux)
- scan-s2.tar.bz2 (scan tool compatible with new DVB-S2 aware S2 API for Linux)
- astra_szap-s2.conf (example configuration file for szap-s2 with only few transponders from Astra 19.2E satellite)
- astra_scan-s2.conf (example configuration file for scan-s2 with only few transponders from Astra 19.2E satellite)

from now on all step are executed in /root/tbs, i.e. "cd /root/tbs" unless it's stated otherwise.

I. install the QBOX2 USB firmware file "dvb-usb-tbsqbox-id5920.fw" to /lib/firmware/:

mv dvb-usb-tbsqbox-id5920.fw /lib/firmware/

II. build, install and load S2API Linix drivers for TBS QBOX2 USB box

II.0 (optional in case packages are already installed) install prerequisite packages using Fedora package manager::

yum install kernel-devel-`uname -r`
yum install gcc

II.1 extract linux-tbs-sources.tar.bz2 archive:

tar xjvf linux-tbs-sources.tar.bz2

II.2 go to driver source code directory:

cd linux-tbs-sources

II.3 build and install the driver:
II.4 make && make install

II.5 reboot in order to load the newly installed driver:

shutdown -r now

II.6 after reboot check that the newly installed driver is loaded correctly:

dmesg | grep QBOX2

if everything is OK, the output from the above command should be similar to:

dvb-usb: TBS QBOX2 DVBS2 USB2.0 successfully deinitialized and disconnected.
dvb-usb: found a 'TBS QBOX2 DVBS2 USB2.0' in cold state, will try to load a firmware
tbsqbox: start downloading TBSQBOX firmware
dvb-usb: found a 'TBS QBOX2 DVBS2 USB2.0' in warm state.
DVB: registering new adapter (TBS QBOX2 DVBS2 USB2.0)
dvb-usb: TBS QBOX2 DVBS2 USB2.0 successfully initialized and connected.

III. here are some basic instructions how to test locking to transponder with "szap-s2":

III.1 extract "szap-s2.tar.bz2" archive:

# tar xjvf szap-s2.tar.bz2

III.2 go to szap-s2 source code directory:

# cd szap-s2

III.3 build szap-s2:

# make

III.4 szap-s2 uses configuration files (see configuration file "astra_szap-s2.conf" for example) - they are simple text files and each line of them contains information about a channel, for example:

BBC:11597:v:0:22000:163:92:10050

this means:

- channel name is BBC, you can choose whatever you want for channel name, it's just a text string

- channel frequency is 11597MHz

- transponder polarization is V(ertical)

- 0: use first LNB (if you have only one LNB, it's always 0, if you have DiSEqC switch and several LNBs connected to that switch it could be number greater than 0 and showing which LNB to use, i.e. to which DiSEqC switch port desired LNB is connected)

- 22000: symbol rate

- 163: Video PID (VPID)

- 92: Audio PID

- 10050: Service ID (SID)

the example is for "BBC World" channel on Astra 19.2E satellite. you can find all those numbers for example here:

III.5 write your szap-s2 configuration files (or create one using S2API compatible version of the "scan" tool)

III.6 use szap-s2 examples:

- to lock to DVB-S transponder: ./szap-s2 -c astra_szap-s2.conf -p -r -S 0 "BBC"

- to lock to DVB-S2: ./szap-s2 -c sample.conf -p -r -S 1 -M 5 -C 23 "CHAN_NAME"

where "-S 1" is DVB-S2, "-M 5" is 8PSK modulation, "-C 23" is FEC 2/3

IV. here are some basic instructions how to scan transponder with "scan-s2":

IV.1 extract "scan-s2.tar.bz2" archive:

# tar xjvf scan-s2.tar.bz2

IV.2 go to scan-s2 source code directory:

# cd scan-s2

IV.3 build scan-s2:

# make

IV.4 scan-s2 uses configuration files (see configuration file "astra_scan-s2.conf" for example) - they are simple text files and each line of them contains information about a transponder, for example:

S1 11778000 V 27500000 3/4 35 QPSK
S2 11362000 H 22000000 2/3 35 8PSK

where:

- "S1" or "S2" indicates the delivery system, i.e. either DVB-S or DVB-S2
- second parameter is the frequency, in our example respectively 11778000 kHz or 11362000 kHz
- "V" or "H" indicates that the polarization: V(ertical) or H(orizontal)
- 5th parameter is the FEC value, in our example respectively 3/4 or 2/3
- the next parameter is the Roll-off factor, "35" in our example
- and the last parameter is the modulation, in our example respectively QPSK or 8PSK

the Roll-off factor and the modulation are mandatory for DVB-S2 cards and without them the result is just unpredictable, most probably - no lock. the reason for that is that DVB-S2 supports several modulation like QPSK, 8PSK, etc and 3 Roll-off factors : 0.20, 0.25, 0.35 (respectively 20, 25, 35 in the configuration file). DVB-S supports only one Roll-off factor - 0.35 and so for DVB-S transponders Roll-off factor is always 35 in the configuration file

IV.5 write your scan-s2 configuration files

IV.6 use scan-s2 to scan a tranposnder
